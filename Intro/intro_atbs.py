About This Book

The first part of this book covers basic Python programming concepts, and the second part covers various tasks
 you can have your computer automate. Each chapter in the second part has project programs for you to study. 
 Here’s a brief rundown of what you’ll find in each chapter:

Part I

Chapter 1. Covers expressions, the most basic type of Python instruction, 
and how to use the Python interactive shell software to experiment with code.

Chapter 2. Explains how to make programs decide which instructions to 
execute so your code can intelligently respond to different conditions.

Chapter 3. Instructs you on how to define your own functions so that you
 can organize your code into more manageable chunks.

Chapter 4. Introduces the list data type and explains how to organize data.

Chapter 5. Introduces the dictionary data type and shows you more 
powerful ways to organize data.

Chapter 6. Covers working with text data (called strings in Python).

Part II

Chapter 7. Covers how Python can manipulate strings and search for 
text patterns with regular expressions.

Chapter 8. Explains how your programs can read the contents of text files
 and save information to files on your hard drive.

Chapter 9. Shows how Python can copy, move, rename, and delete large 
numbers of files much faster than a human user can. It also explains 
compressing and decompressing files.

Chapter 10. Shows how to use Python’s various bug-finding and bug-fixing tools.

Chapter 11. Shows how to write programs that can automatically download 
web pages and parse them for information. This is called web scraping.

Chapter 12. Covers programmatically manipulating Excel spreadsheets so 
that you don’t have to read them. This is helpful when the number of 
documents you have to analyze is in the hundreds or thousands.

Chapter 13. Covers programmatically reading Word and PDF documents.

Chapter 14. Continues to explain how to programmatically manipulate 
documents with CSV and JSON files.

Chapter 15. Explains how time and dates are handled by Python programs 
and how to schedule your computer to perform tasks at certain times. This 
chapter also shows how your Python programs can launch non-Python programs.

Chapter 16. Explains how to write programs that can send emails and text 
messages on your behalf.

Chapter 17. Explains how to programmatically manipulate images such as 
JPEG or PNG files.

Chapter 18. Explains how to programmatically control the mouse and 
keyboard to automate clicks and keypresses.
